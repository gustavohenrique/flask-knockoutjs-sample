# flask-knockoutjs-sample

It is a personal financial software.
The goal of this project was mostly to learn how to integrate flask + mongodb. Finally I switched from mongodb to mysql because it was not necessary nosql database on the architecture used. This app is a POC. Ignore the design layout and bugs found.

## Running the App

1. Install the dependencies in requirements.txt
2. Edit the settings file to configure database. For mongodb, checkout another branch
3. The Makefile file contains all tasks. Execute `make run` and open the URL http://localhost:5000
